I love to travel to beautiful destinations as well as create beautiful interactive applications. I am currently studying in the U of M Coding Bootcamp in order to start a career in Full Stack Web Development.</p><p> I have spent a decade of my professional time training others, coaching and developing their management skills as well as managing large groups of people.</p><p> I spent the first ten years of my professional life working for Burger King. I learned many skills; time management,people management, composure and temperment management, managing a P & L, everything HR (and MORE!) I ended my career with Burger King as a District Manager two years ago.</p><p> I am currently working for Office Depot at a Store Manager. The change of pace has granted me the ability to pursue a career I am more interested in.</p><p> On the lighter side of things I have a love for commitment! I have a turtle named Princess who I have had for over 15 years. My favorite places I have visited so far have been Puerto Rico, Alaska and NYC.</p><p> In Puerto Rico I signed up for a trip that seemed fun and adventurous to explore a cave. Little did I know that I would be in the cave for 8 hours and had to zipline and repel into the cave. At the time is seemed impossible, but reminiscing its pretty exciting that I did it! (... at the end they made us rock climb back up, AND I got to see a crab eating a bat! A bat eating crab!)</p><p> Alaska was a little less intense, I rented a car and drove as far as the roads would take me around Anchorage. From Copper Creek to Seward. Spent a few nights camping, and took a few trips out walking on glaciers and kayaking through some as well.</p><p> The best trip was NYC, food everywhere!</p></div>`);
